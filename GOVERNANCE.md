### Build Working Group

The Node.js Build Working Group is jointly governed by a Working Group (WG)
that is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.

The WG has final authority over this project including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

For the current list of WG members, see the project
[README.md](./README.md#current-project-team-members).

### Collaborators

The Build GitHub repository is
maintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are added by the
WG on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These
individuals are identified by the WG and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed during the weekly WG meeting.

_Note:_ If you make a significant contribution and are not considered
for commit-access log an issue or contact a WG member directly and it
will be brought up in the next WG meeting.

Modifications of the contents of the Build repository are made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required
for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
participate and there is disagreement around a particular
modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detail
on the consensus model used for governance.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the
WG for discussion by assigning the ***WG-agenda*** tag to a pull
request or issue. The WG should serve as the final arbiter where
required.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project
[README.md](./README.md#build-wg-members).

### WG Membership

WG seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the WG.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG
membership beyond these rules. (I think this needs tweaking?)

The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.

A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by
unanimous consensus of all other WG members.

Changes to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be
suggested as any other agenda item (see "WG Meetings" below).

If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full
WG is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal
is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting.  This is to ensure
that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all
membership decisions.  If a WG member is unable to attend a meeting
where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent
is assumed.

DRAFT

Once a year the Build Working Group will perform an audit of its
membership and membership of the jenkins-admins and jenkins-release-admins
teams. This is to protect the sensitive build resources by ensuring that
only active members have access to these resources. During this audit any
member can volunteer their removal from the working group or teams if they
do not have the time to continue working on the project. Any emeritus
member may rejoin the working group following consensus from the current
working group.

### WG Meetings

The WG meets fortnightly on a Zoom Webinar. A designated moderator
approved by the WG runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.

Items are added to the WG agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, WG membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
WG member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***WG-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each WG meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with
members of the WG. WG members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the WG
cannot veto or remove items.

The WG may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to
participate in a non-voting capacity.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

### Consensus Seeking Process

The WG follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.

Note that changes to WG membership require unanimous consensus.  See
"WG Membership" above.
